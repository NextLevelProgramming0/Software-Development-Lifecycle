How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

In an Agile-Scrum environment the user needs would be interpreted initially by the Product Owners communication with the client, customer, user, or stakeholders and then the info will be defined in user stories (the extra details should be given to you by the client, etc.).  The user needs will be implemented into the program based on the user stories and will be checked by the Tester's Test Cases and in the program using try...catch code.

In an environment where a waterfall approach is used more if not all of the details for the project should be defined up front because changes to the program or process midway through can create complications with completing or changing the code, create extra costs, and extend the time it takes to finish the project (sometimes making it impossible to realistically complete the program in a timely manner).

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Based on the knowledge I have gained from this and my past courses I would approach developing programs incrementally because details or project tasks can change. For the work that I am required to do I would follow the 'Just Barely Enough' approach so that we don't waste company time or resources and the project can move forward between sprints in an accurate and efficient manner.  If I do get done with what is required for the current sprint I would see if my peers need help.  If not, after consulting the Product Owner or Scrum Master, I would consider future sprints and begin working on possible code for the future.  The four agile principles from the Scrum-Agile Manifesto I will choose to focus on for excellent are below:
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts it behavior accordingly.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To be a good team member is to know your role but to continue to strive/promote excellence within the team while being available to help, adjust, and adapt for others so that we can all be at reach our best potential in completing the Project.
